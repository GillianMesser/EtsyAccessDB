# Summary
This is a quick database I dummied up when we were considering setting up an Etsy shop.  It tracks your available equipment (and estimated cost for repairs), materials (and cost), labor types (and cost), and listings.  For your listings, you can add what materials/equipment/labor will be required for that product.  The system will then determine a minimum recommended list price based on your profit type (either based on a straight profit margin or on full labor cost) plus your provided shipping estimate plus the cost of materials/equipment/Etsy fees.  You can set the actual price to be whatever you want it to be.

# What are the files?
HobbyShopListings.accdb - empty database with applicable forms, tables, reports built in.  Enable Content at the top of your screen when you first launch the system.  The dashboard should load automatically.  It is recommended that you use the dashboard for navigation, but the navigation pane is still accessible on the left in case you need to access the tables or forms directly.

ExampleListingsReport.pdf - this is an example report generated with dummy data that shows the active listings in the database as well as their price information.

Map.pdf - this is the initial map of tables, fields, keys, and relationships I used to build the database structure.

Images folder - this contains some simple screen grabs of the various forms and views in the database with some dummy information filled out as an example.
